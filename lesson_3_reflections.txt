	by yourself, it can be used as a back up in case the local copy gets corrupted

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	If git pulls automatically conflict will most likely to result in the code. By doing it manually, 
	you can decide when you want to integrate the changes introduced by the new update

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Fork is when you make a copy of a repository from another person to your account on github. Useful when you want to make changes but don't have edit power in the original repository
	Clone is when you make a copy of a repository on github to your local machine. Use when collaborating with others
	Branch is extention from a master branch. Use when creating a new feature or bug fix

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	Allows you to work offline. Also provides you a way to view the changes between online repository
	and the local one
